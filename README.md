# Path-Loss-Prediction-in-Smart-Campus-Environment-using-Machine-Learning-
Implemented various machine learning algorithms to calculate path loss of signals and concluded random forest as the best algorithm to predict path loss. Documentation for this research work has been submitted to the reviewers of VTC conference which is scheduled at Belgium in May 2020.
